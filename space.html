          The Moon is the Earth's natural satellite. It has circled around the Earth for at least four billion years. 
          It is a rocky ball about a quarter of Earth's size and is held in its orbit by mutual gravitational attraction. <br><br>
          Most scientists believe that the Moon formed when, early in Earth's history, a planet smashed into it. 
          The impact was so tremendous that nothing was left of the planet but a few hot splashes thrown back up into space.
          Within a day of the smash, these splashes had been drawn together by gravity to form the Moon.

          The Moon is by far the brightest thing in the night sky. But it has no light of its own.
          Moonlight is simply the Sun's light reflected off the white dust on the Moon's surface.<br>
          The Moon's gravity draws the oceans into an oval around the Earth, creating a bulge of water on each side of the world. These bulges stay beneath the Moon as the Earth spins round and so seem to run around the world, making the tide rise and fall as they pass.

      <p id="sun1">The Sun is an average star, just like countless others in the universe. It formed from gas left behind after an earlier, 
        much larger star blew up and now, in middle-age, burns yellow and fairly steadily - giving the Earth daylight and remarkably constant 
        temperatures. Besides heat and light, the Sun sends out deadly gamma rays, X-rays and ultraviolet, as well as infrared and radio waves. 
        Fortunately we are shielded from these by Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p id="sun2">
        The Sun is a small-to-medium-sized star 1,392,000 km in diameter. It weighs just under 2.000 trillion trillion tonnes.<br>
        The Sun gets its heat from nuclear fusion.
        Huge pressures deep inside the Sun force the nuclei (cores) of hydrogen atoms to fuse together to make helium atoms, releasing huge amounts of nuclear energy.<br>
        The Sun's crown is its corona, its glowing white hot atmosphere seen only as a halo when the rest of the Sun's disc is blotted out by the Moon in a solar eclipse.

        Around 4.6 billion years ago, neither the Earth nor any of the other planets existed. There was just this vast, dark, very hot 
        cloud of gas and dust swirling around the newly formed Sun. Gradually, the cloud cooled and the gas began to condense into billions 
        of droplets. Slowly these droplets were pulled together into clumps by their own gravity - and they carried on clumping until all 
        the planets, including the Earth, were formed.
But it took another half a billion years before the Earth had cooled enough to form a solid crust with an atmosphere around it.

      <p id="e2">
        The Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. The oldest rock is about 3.8 billion years old. Scientists have also dated meteorites 
        that have fallen from space, and must have formed at the same time as the Earth.<br>
        Satellite measurements show it is
40,075 km around the equator and 12,757 km across. The diameter between the Poles is slightly less, by 43 km.<br>
The Earth has a core of iron and nickel, and a rocky crust made mostly of oxygen and silicon.
In between is the soft, hot mantle of metal silicates, sulphides and oxides.
